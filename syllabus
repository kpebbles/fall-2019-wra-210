This course also asks you to practice an ideal form of such a relationship. Our class meetings are intended to provide a safe space in which everyone feels comfortable sharing perspectives, asking questions, and taking productive risks. Each member of our community will be treated with respect; disrespect toward members of our community or the goals and activities of our community will not be tolerated. Such unacceptable behaviors include: leaving early, arriving late, or otherwise indicating that you’re “not really here”; reading or writing outside material – electronic or print – during class meetings; making rude comments regarding students, me as the instructor, or course material; inhibiting others’ participation or refusing to engage in learning activities. Displaying any of these unacceptable behaviors may result in being asked to leave the class for the day with a recorded absence, and you will be asked to meet with me and appropriate WRAC administration, as needed. If you feel uncomfortable within the class community or are upset with any aspect of our course, please let me know in a mature, respectful way. I’ll be happy to work with you to find a solution.<br/><li/><ul/><br/></strong><br/>Attendance and Participation</strong><br />Discussion and collaboration are essential parts of this course, as are in-class tutorials and workshops. Attendance in class is essential, so you are expected to attend class regularly and have completed any necessary preparation. You get two free absences - any absences after that and your overall grade will be reduced by .3 for each class missed. Another way to think of this is many jobs offer “PTO” or “paid time off.” As a new employee, it is not uncommon to receive up to 2 weeks of PTO in your first year. This time is approximately 4% of your working hours, so you may also have up to 4% of your working hours as PTO for this course, or 2 absences. While you do not need to provide documentation for your absence, it is a professional courtesy to email me when you know you will be absent. These absences are for ALL reasons: religious holidays/observances, sickness, appointments, vacation, non-class field trips, etc., so please plan ahead. Avoid skipping class without a legitimate reason.<br/><br/> Coming to class late (more than 5 minutes after we begin) 2 times will equal one absence. So, come to class, it's fun! If you miss class, you will miss important stuff.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong>Assignments and Grading</strong><br />You must complete all major assignments in order to pass this class. Scoring guides for each assignment will be provided well in advance of their due dates so that students are well informed of the instructor's expectations. Course work should be submitted according to guidelines and on time; late work will only be accepted at the discretion of the professor. Lateness is considered to be any time after class on the day the course work is due.<strong> Note: </strong>all assignments must be turned in online through your personal course site via live links - you cannot email in assignments.<br /><br/>All this said, life happens. If you find yourself in a situation that affects your learning, let me know as soon as possible, and we will develop a plan for you. These situations may include bereavement, medical emergencies for yourself or family, and other emergencies. Please TALK WITH ME as soon as possible -- do NOT wait until week 12 or 13 or later to try to make up an entire semester’s worth of work.<br/>All-in-all: ATTENDANCE MATTERS! You need to be here to contribute to our learning community.<br/><span></span><br /><span></span><strong>Major Assignments and Projects</strong><ul><li><strong>Personal Course Site: 150 points</strong>. Create a site that will serve as your home base for this course and as a course portfolio. The site must include at least one page designed for this course that includes basic contact information, links to assignment submissions, and other materials that are relevant to the class. An initial version is due the first week of class as part of your first module grade. You'll use it throughout the semester to collect and present all of the work you do for this course (particularly your modules) in one, easy-to-use view.</li><li><strong>Modules: 300 Points</strong>. A series of 13 short exercises designed to introduce you to key concepts and to give hands-on practice with important tools and techniques throughout the semester. Your work for each module will be posted to your personal course site. You must complete at least 10 of the modules to earn a passing grade for this semester-long project, but completing all of them will earn you extra credit.</li><li><strong>Portfolio Design Documents: 150 Points</strong>. The major semester-long project will be designing your professional portfolio that you'll maintain throughout your academic career. Before you build anything for that project, you will develop a series of design documents that will guide that project, serving as a blueprint for the site you eventually build. This will require you to learn key genres in web design. Specifically, you will learn about and make sitemaps, wireframes, and design comps for your portfolio.</li><li><strong>Professional Writing Portfolio: 400 Points</strong>. Over the course of the semester, you will design and build a portfolio website. This will be a starting point for your professional portfolio, something that you can maintain throughout your degree and develop further in either WRA 410 (Advanced Web Authoring) or WRA 455 (Portfolio Seminar). You will research what characteristics define an effective portfolio and develop initial designs that will be reviewed by your peers and then revised. You will then build a functional version of your design over the course of several weeks after a series of tutorials and hands-on workshops. Your final grade for this project will be based on the functional HTML and CSS you produce, how well what you built adheres to your designs, and a reflection in which you discuss your work on the project.</li></ul><br /><strong>Revising Assignments</strong><br />Revision is an important part of the writing (and coding) process. To that end, you will be allowed to revise any of your projects for a higher grade. Consult with me if you plan to revise. You have exactly seven days (one week) after receiving your grade on the module - after those seven days your grade will be final. You must email me to let me know that you will revise - the email will contain your intent to revise and extensive descriptions of the changes made as you compare what you did incorrectly to the new revised text. Without this email, I cannot tell when you have revised and what you have revised.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong>Grades and Grading Scale</strong><br />Course projects will generate 1000 total points over the semester. Based on a 1000-point scale, the following table describes how final grades will be assigned.<br /><span></span><br /><strong>Points &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grade</strong><br />1000-950 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.0<br />949-875 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.5&nbsp;<br />874-800 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.0<br />799-750 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.5<br />749-700 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0<br />699-650 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.5<br />649-600 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.0<br />599-below &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong>University Academic Honesty Policy</strong><br />Academic Honesty-Article 2.3.3 of Academic Freedom Report states "the student shares with the faculty the responsibility for maintaining integrity of scholarship, grades, and professional standards." In addition, the College of Arts and Letters adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulation, 1.0, Protection of Scholarships and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who commit an act of academic dishonesty may receive a 0.0 on the assignment or in the course. For additional information, see MSU's ombudsman's website.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>Be advised: copying code, particularly as a programmer, is common practice. For the purpose of course assignments where you are asked to demonstrate your understanding of the structure and syntax, you will be expected to compose your own and to document your work through comments.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong><br />To receive any accommodation for any disability, students must first register with the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities. The RCPD will request appropriate documentation and make a determination regarding the nature of the accommodation to which a student is entitled. The RCPD will then give the student a visa that specifies the kind of accommodation that may be provided. It is then the responsibility of the student seeking accommodation to present the visa to his/her instructor.<br /><span></span></div></div>
